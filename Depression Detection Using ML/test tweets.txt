### Negative
Many sufferers of depression aren't sad; they feel nothing at all, or a persistent and nagging anxiety.

don't mistake a bad day with depression! everyone has 'em!

I feel like crying every time someone askes how you feel, because you can not lie about it but at the same time don't want to bother them with your problems

i know i'm the reason for my depression but i have no motivation to change??

The lack of this understanding is a small but significant part of what causes anxiety & depression to both feel so incredibly lonely. It's soooo easy to compare. It's so easy to invalidate ourselves because of that.
