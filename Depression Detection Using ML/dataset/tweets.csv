cough sneeze be tho worst,1
i can be your sad whore ahaha,1
bro that feel you get after you sneeze,1
long piss be the best,1
dwight you ignorant slut,1
the real reason why you be sad you be attach to people who have be distant with you you be pay attention to people who ignore you you make time for people who be too busy for you you be too care to people who be care less when it come to you let those people go,1
my biggest problem be overthinking everything,1
the worst sadness be the sadness you have teach yourself to hide,1
i cannot make you understand i cannot make anyone understand what be happen inside me i cannot even explain it to myself,1
i do not think anyone really understand how tire it be to act okay and always be the strong one when in reality you be close to the edge,1
the worst feel be when something be kill you inside and you have to act like you do not care,1
when i be hurt i shut down i turn into a total bitch i shut off my emotions i act differently towards everything and everyone and i hate it,1
overthinking ruin you ruin the situation twist things around make you worry and just make everything much worse than it actually be,1
i be disappoint in myself because i know i be better than the choices i keep make and the things i choose to deal with,1
i be just so tire of this my body be tire my mind be a mess i just really want to lay in bed and never get up i be just so tire of life,1
be you okay me no but it be okay,1
i be sick of make things worse i be sick of be hurt i be sick of cry myself to sleep i be sick of hat everything i be sick of fake a smile i be sick of feel this way i be sick of let people down i be sick of be me,1
live with depression and anxiety no motivation to leave your bed dread leave your house not be able to go out unable to make new friends be paranoid or restless mentally hurt zone out a lot ignore people not be yourself,1
sorry for be so fuck up sorry for be such a failure sorry for be a disgrace sorry for be me,1
do you ever write a really long message and about halfway through you be like you know what they do not even care and end up delete it,1
i be tire go to sleep then no you do not understand,1
you hide when you cry because you want to be see as a strong person at the same time though you hate how nobody notice how break you be,1
please do not expect me to always be good and kind and love there be time when i will be cold and thoughtless and really hard to understand,1
i do not think people really understand just how stressful it be to explain what be on your mind when you do not even understand it yourself,1
i be scar to get close to people because i think they will eventually walk out of my life no matter how close we be because everyone leave,1
i think i be afraid to be happy because whenever i get too happy something bad always happen,1
i hate get so sad to the point where my body completely shut down and all i can do be just lay there and think about all my problems,1
i already know i be not good enough,1
sleep be so hard when you cannot stop think,1
i be not the same anymore i will admit it a lot of shit get to me,1
social anxiety suck you unintentionally make yourself sad you feel alone even when you be not and sometimes you do not even know what be wrong,1
i say sorry a lot because i secretly feel that everything be my fault,1
it suck do not it feel like you be not good enough no matter how hard you try,1
depression be not always sadness it can also be emptiness anger tiredness or loneliness sometimes a cry for help be not so visible,1
do you ever feel physically sick because you know you be not good enough for anyone and cannot do anything right no matter how hard you try,1
i wish someone be afraid to lose me i be always scar of lose people that i love but i doubt anyone would fight to keep me in their life,1
i be just so tire of this my body be tire my mind be a mess i just really want to lay in bed and never get up i be just so tire of life,1
sometimes i be disappoint in myself because i know i be better than the choices i make and the things i choose to deal with,1
you can only be so strong for so long until you reach a point where you break physically mentally emotional,1
my biggest mistake ever be think that people care for me as much as i do for them but in reality it be almost always one side,1
i do not tweet for sympathy or attention i express my thoughts and feel this be my outlet where i can say stuff without feel judge,1
when i die do not go to my grave and sit there tell me how much you love and miss me those be the things i need to hear when i be alive,1
i truly feel like everything i say or do be always wrong like i be a total disappointment to everyone and all i ever do be let people down,1
i overthink a lot i be sensitive and clingy but i really do try my hardest to be good enough so i be sorry if that be not enough,1
do you ever just sit there and realize that you mean nothing to anyone and you start feel lose alone and unloved and truly unwanted,1
she pretend like nothing happen because she want people to see her strong only she know how painful emotionaly mentally she really be,1
be sad for no reason be worse than be sad for a reason because there be absolutely nothing you can do to make yourself feel better,1
i prefer to distance myself whenever i be mad because i turn into the most heartless person you will ever meet and you be go hate me for that,1
i be sorry for be annoy when i want to talk needy because i miss you emotional when i care and insecure because i be afraid to lose you,1
why be you sad i do not know no reason oh no there be plenty of reason i be just not really sure which one it be this time,1
do you ever feel ok but your sad at the same time you just want to talk to someone and hug them but you feel annoy so you just stay quiet,1
she might be laugh but deep inside she be hurt she be try to get her mind off things that make her upset by pretend to be fine,1
i literally notice the smallest of change in how people treat me and i overthink into think everyone hat me,1
you unintentionally make yourself sad you feel alone even when you be not and sometimes you do not even know what be wrong,1
people think you be rude or always in a bad mood,1
it be easier just to say i be fine when somebody ask if you be okay because sometimes it be not possible to explain why you be not,1
do you ever just make up scenarios in your head that you know will never happen but it make you so happy so you just keep on imagine them,1
oh ok actually mean my heart just get rip into a million piece but i will not tell you because you would not care how i feel anyway,1
i never really know where i stand in some people life one minute they treat me like i be something special then nothing the next,1
the worst feel be when you find out you do not mean as much to someone as you think you do and you look so stupid for care too much,1
every night i think about all the mistake i have make and how much i regret make those decisions because my life could have be different,1
the worst type of cry be at night when everyone be asleep and you have to control it with your hand over your mouth to not make a sound,1
sometimes it be better to keep silent than to tell others how you feel because it hurt know they can hear you but not understand you,1
i hate get flashbacks from things you do not want to remember it feel like your heart suddenly drop and anxiety start take you over,1
i be sorry i have trust issue but when you give someone everything and they toss it away like nothing something inside of you break,1
i need someone who will understand how unstable i be sometimes be alone can be dangerous for me but other time its exactly what i need,1
my only relief be to sleep when i be sleep i be not sad i be not angry i be not scar i be not hurt i be not lonely i be just nothing,1
i hate this feel like i be here but i be notlike someone care but they do not it be like i belong somewhere anywhere but here,1
have you ever want to cry but no tear come out so you just stare blankly into space while feel your heart break into a million piece,1
i feel myself change i do not laugh the same anymore i do not smile the same or talk the same i be just so tire and mentally exhaust,1
pain change people it make them trust less overthink more and shut people out,1
nothing hurt more then be ignore replace forget lie to,1
you think you be do okay and then suddenly it be a nighttime and you be alone and you be not really sure how to distract yourself anymore,1
all the things i do wrong 1 i rely on someone for my happiness 2 i love people more than i love myself 3 i never ask for help,1
we hide behind a fake smile to mask the pain but sometimes we wish someone would look closely enough and see how break we really be inside,1
type haha when you cannot even smile act like you be happy when all you want to do be cry tell everyone you be okay when you be not,1
do you ever feel the need to ask someone if they actually still want you in their life because it always feel like they do not really care,1
you smile but all you want be to cry you talk but you really just want to be quiet you pretend like you be happy but you really be not,1
that worthless feel where you should just lock yourself in a dark room because everything you do or say just seem to piss people off,1
she be scar to get to close to anyone anymore because everyone who promise her they would stay turn their back on her and walk away,1
have you ever be in one of those moods where you do not really know what be wrong but you feel really irritate with everyone and everything,1
i be scar to get close to people because i think they will eventually walk out of my life no matter how close we be because they always do,1
fghhhhjjjj,1
fgjj,1
she be hurt mentally and emotionally but everyday she walk with a smile because that be who she be the girl who never stop smile,1
when i be hurt i shut down i turn into a total bitch i shut off my emotions i act differently towards everything and everyone and i hate it,1
so many people in this world have trust issue because people say i be here for you and then run away as soon as things start to fall apart,1
just because her eye do not tear up do not mean her heart do not cry and just because she come off strong do not mean nothing be wrong,1
hate get flashbacks from things you do not want to remember it feel like your heart suddenly drop and anxiety start take over Õ¾ou,1
when i cry about one thing i end up cry about everything that be mess up in my life,1
it really suck want to talk to someone but you really do not want to annoy anyone because they seem totally fine without you,1
everything be change and i do not know where i fit anymore,1
they say it will get better but its a lie it do not get better you just get use to it,1
it be painful to say goodbye to someone you do not want to let go but more painful to ask someone to stay when you know they want to leave,1
i hate the fact that i cry when i be angry and that be the worst thing ever because you be try to act tough and mean but instead you cry,1
every night i convince myself tomorrow will be different but it never be,1
my biggest problem be overthinking everything,1
you smile but you want to cry you talk but you just want to be quiet and you pretend that you be happy but you be not,1

do not worry about me i will be fine just do not look into my eye,1
i tell everybody to be strong when i be the weakest person on this world,1
i wonder how many people have see my cut and just never say anything,1
they keep say it get better but when it be not change anything for me i be worthless,1
the scariest part be the realisation that you have lose yourself completely sink in as you lay awake at 2 be because you lose the ability to sleep and you cannot even cry because you do not even care adh,1
i want to talk about it damn it i want to scream i want to yell i want to shout about it but all i could do be whisper i be fine,1
i be fall apart i be barely breathe with a break heart that be still beat,1
i do not know what i be alive or just breathe,1
what a shame that the girl who once believe in fairytales and magic have to be strike by reality with demons in her mind and the fear of never be love kf,1

i care about all of you if you need someone to talk to my dms be open and if you just want to rant to someone i be here lot of love,1
i be a paradox i be neither happy nor i be sad i smile at pretty things and laugh at funny things but late at night i become a mess of emotions and thoughts and i wish i could just disappear,1
what do not kill you leave scar ruin your lungs dry out all you tear leaven you lie awake at 4 in the morning wish you be not alive,1
the saddest kind of sad be when your tear cannot even drop and you feel nothing it be like the world have just end you do not cry you do not hear you do not see you just stay there for a second the heart die anonymous,1
i be the type of girl who could have tear stream down my face amp still insist that everything be fine,1
empty lonley sad depress forget useless worthless unimportant and unloved the worst feel in the world but they be the way i feel everyday,1
suicide be stupid you want to know what be stupid hurt someone so much emotionally that they think suicide be the only anwer,1
you break me like i be one of your fuck promise,1
i be not a stranger to the dark hide away they say because we do not want your break part i have learn to be ashamed of all my scar run away they say no onell love you as you be this be me keala settle,1
you know those nights where you lay in your bed and have your hand on your mouth so you do not make a sound as tear stream down your face and you can feel your heart just break,1
just scar they be not just scar they be the demons i fight at 3 be they be my insecurities my deepest fear and my lonely nights they be the insult i have receive and the emotions i cannot contain they be part of me and be what i have become,1
i know what it be like to want to die how it hurt to smile how you try to fit in but you cannot how you hurt yourself on the outside to try to kill the thing on the inside,1
our brain be sick but that be okay because our grade matter more than our health anyway,1
no matter how much i try to make myself look do not matter i know they do and that be why i do not amount to anything because i be ugly,1
happy new year babes you all survive 2017 and i be very proud of you guy,1
i draw with silver and it turn red magic,1
monsters do not sleep under your bed they sleep inside of your head,1
dear me i hate you you be weak you deserve the pain you be imperfect you will never be good enough i hope you die,1
depression be not always at 3 be sometimes it hit you at 3pm when you be whit your friends and half way through a laugh and just stop,1
sorry mom and dad you have a suicidal kid but i promise i be go to put my best fake smile in front of you all,1
i only lie so i do not have to see tear of disappointment in you eye,1
the human skin can be hard to live in that be why most of us tear it open arg,1
behind my smile be a hurt heart behind my laugh i be fall apart look closely at me and you will see the girl i be be not me,1
have you ever want to cry but no tear come out so you just stare blankly into space while feel your heart breake into piece,1
if you guy really need someone to talk to i be here and i care about all of you,1
fake smile dry eye scratch wrists bruise thighs white pills rope tide gun load suicide,1
you be right to call me unstable i be a walk fuck disaster,1
dear mom i be sorry i could not make you any prouder of me i be sorry i do not turn out the way you want me to be i be sorry i be a disappointment to you,1
4 be be when i loose all control when i beg for my razor when i clench my hand in to fists to try to stop them from shake when i curl up in a ball to muffle my sob and my shake body still as i can 4 be be when i silently shatter behind close doors and try to stay alive,1
no one really care until something dramatic happen,1
everyone have scar that they do not want to talk about mine be just on my body as well as in my head,1
you do not have to tell me i be worthless trust me i already know,1
i stop talk about how i felt because i know no one care anyway,1
amaze how much long sleeves and a fake smile can hide,1
maybe that be it we eventually go numb because you cannot break a hearts that already break,1
you just keep go and go until you crash and cry about everything and anything at all,1
i kill someone you see i kill the girl who use to be me,1
she say she be fine but she be go insane she say she feel good but she be in a lot of pain she say it be nothing but it be really a lot she say she be okay but really she be not,1
you smile but you want to cry you talk but you want to be quiet you pretend that you be happy but you be not,1
people do not die from suicide they die from sadness anonymous,1
the worst feel be want to cry but have to hold it because your in public,1
she finally let go of her fake smile and tear slowly roll down her face as she whisper to herself i do not want to be me,1
my biggest fear be that eventually you will see me the way i see myself,1
wil could ever love the girl with scar,1
the loneliest moment in someone be life be when they be watch their whole world fall apart and all they can do be stare blankly,1
you be afraid to tell people how you feel because it will destroy them so you bury it deep inside yourself where it destroy you,1
i hate it when people tell me to just be happy so you think i choose to just be depress,1
fake friends be like shadow they follow you in the sun but leave you in the dark,1
most girls my age have a pretty face i just have scar,1
have you ever lay on your bed at night and cry because you be not good enough count all your flaw and felt worse about yourself and just felt to ugly and alone,1
the fault the blame the pain still there i be here alone inside of this break home break home,1
stop ask me to trust you when i be still cough up the water from the last time you let me drown,1
i never know how to handle sadness cry make me feel stupid,1
when cancer take a life we blame cancer depression be a disease do not blame the victim for lose the fight,1
let the darkness consume me,1
erase my existence no one will notice,1
i think i get better in reality it become worse than it be before,1
the voice in my head just will not shut up,1
i be fine i be just tire it be just my allergies something get into my eye i be really fine,1
they say to not compare yourself on social media but it be hard to not when you look the way you do and the mirror be just right there,1

my mind be tell me to end it all,1

i feel so alone as always,1

just want to not care and move on,1
when you be so tire but you just cannot sleep,1
talk to wall,1
i do not belong here,1
star at the ceiling and wonder how i can end it all,1
sometimes it hurt so bad you cannot breathe,1
just admit it no one want me,1
i feel uglier and uglier everytime i see a reflection of myself,1

mirror mirror on the wall who be the ugliest of them all me,1
i hate myself so much,1
i feel so suffocate,1
isolate this be not new to me,1
when it be hurt so much all you can do be lie there and stare at the ceiling,1
just because it be not show do not mean it do not hurt,1
it will be okay stay strong even if you feel everything fall apart,1
drown,1
i want to disappear,1
2020 have be really dreadful so far,1

i draw and draw and draw to distract me from the pain i be feel,1
everytime,1
you will never understand the pain i felt,1

i just want to leave but i be too break to go anywhere,1
they promise not to leave but they leave,1

cross roads and hop some car would run me over,1
even someone who claim they love me ignore me be it text or facetoface that be just how irrelevant i be,1

too tire to even breathe anymore,1
i just do not want to stay here anymore it be not like anyone would notice if i be go,1

i try so hard until one day i stop try,1
i deserve this pain it be my fault always be always will be,1

where be everyone when i need them i have be there for everyone because i know what it feel like to be alone to have no one but no one be ever there when i need them,1
everyone think i be so happygolucky because i laugh and smile all the time and they think i be so strong and i can handle it but honestly i cannot i be not strong enough and i just cover it up it be alright no one need to know because they do not care,1

i do not belong here i should not exist,1
i be just a toy people use and throw when they be bore with me,1
no one be there for me when i be there for them,1
why would anyone love me anyway,1
i be the least of your priorities i know i be worthless,1
it be sad how someone who you have see once or twice in school decide to take their own life and it be affect you because you know the feel of be stress out helpless and alone and you cannot do anything about it,1
anxiety make me breathless lol,1
i be tire of be ignore but it just cannot be help i be worthless,1
when people point out your flaw and all you can do be laugh it off and act like it be not affect you,1
they ignore you yet question when you be silent,1
no one be ever there for me but they expect me to be there for them,1
everyone be get tire of me so be i,1
why do i exist,1
star into space seem more interest than listen in class,1
scream on the inside smile on the outside,1
you will never understand the empty feel inside me,1
it be clear that i do not belong here i be just a nuisance,1
drown yet no one can see,1
look in the mirror and there be not one thing i like to see,1
so use to be ignore but it be so painful everytime it make me feel like i be not worth the time whichi guess i be not,1
i tend to push everyone out of my life,1
i feel so alone in a city full of people,1
that empty feel in me stay,1
the year of be alone,1
i be use to it,1
i do not feel the need to open up to anyone anymore,1
fall apart,1
even tear cannot fall now i feel nothing i feel like nothing i be useless,1
my wall just keep get higher and higher block everyone out,1
i be so tire of every single thing,1
that empty feel i cannot get rid of,1
i be at that point where i do not need anyone or rather no one need me,1
i be a burden,1
i cannot do this any longer,1
i do not belong here no one disagree,1
everyone be just too busy for me i guess i be not worth their time,1
walk on the road not bother to look leave or right anymore,1
they pretend to understand you,1
fire be beautiful from far however like me come any closer and you will get hurt,1

i have anxiety about almost everything,1
relatable,1
i do not want to feel anything,1
it hurt so bad,1
insomnia take over,1
everyone be too busy for me i guess i be not important as always,1
no one want me here i do not belong i be worthless,1
one blade a day keep the thoughts away,1
i be slowly lose it,1
it be so loud in my head,1
it hurt so bad but all i can do be lie there and do nothing,1
sometimes i do not even know what to feel anymore it be just blank,1
slowly push everyone away,1
you do not know when i fake it,1
sleep be my only escape but how do i sleep when the thoughts be keep me awake,1
when i be alone in a room so silent the demons inside me come out to play,1
people change do not expect them to be the same person you know years before,1
i feel so dead on the outside and inside,1
i be not important to anyone i be nothing,1
dear diary i do not want to live anymore,1
overthinking,1
i care too much before now i do not,1
everyone do the same it be just all talk no action until something happen,1
mentally and physically drain,1
music have always be there for me when no one have,1
sick of everything and everyone,1
i may look perfectly normal on the outside but my mind be fill with thoughts that destroy me from the inside,1
you help them when they need you but when you need them where be they,1
do not miss me when i be go because you never do when i be not,1
the way i be feel right now i might as well just be dead,1
i be so tire but i just cannot sleep,1
most things be easier say than do,1
i feel so suffocate at home and yet it be where i feel the safest,1
we all die alone anyway,1
i look at everyone around me and constantly compare myself to them i lose everytime,1
if you think for a second that they carethey do not,1
constant thoughts of die,1
i have to feel the pain to feel alive,1
it hurt so bad and yet i have to keep a smile on to prevent more question ask,1
cry silently and no one notice a thing,1
the pain i feel keep me alive,1
not look both ways anymore when i cross the road,1
i be not a priority since the begin,1
just push everyone away because they will eventually leave you anyway,1
you think i be okay but i be not,1
sit alone let the thoughts flow through my head like an endless stream,1
leave me alone if you have nothing nice to say,1
eternal sleep,1
everything change and happiness will not last,1
what be the point of do it if no one appreciate it,1
everyone start care when it be too late,1
everything be a mess,1
the more i go on the less i care,1
i can tell when you be lie straight to my face,1
just fake a smile and they will think that you be fine,1
nothing be how i be to everyone,1
how no one ever listen to you eventually make you feel alone and suicidal,1
my opinions do not even matter to anyone anymore i be always invincible,1
i do not need you to point out my flaw for me i see them myself,1
look in the mirror all i see be my imperfections,1
constant thoughts of suicide,1
when they tell you to sleep but it be not like you do not want to you just cannot,1
even before i eat i feel fat,1
cannot be perfect will never be perfect,1
if i be to disappear i will not waste anyones time money and space,1
just fake a smile that be all i need to do to fool you,1
i need to disconnect from reality,1
everyone hat me i know i hate me too,1
emotionally drain,1
nobody truly care until you make a mistake,1
you do not have to indirectly tell me that i be fat i know i be,1
insomnia over think numb,1
everyone who enter my life leave anyway,1
it be dangerous in my mind,1
the word replay in my head puncture my heart,1
look in the mirror i see something i hate the most my face,1
they think if i look happy i be fine,1
that pain in your chest in which you feel emotionally and physically,1
if i be not hurt myself i end up hurt those around me,1
as ugly as always,1
they be so use to you that they think nothing be wrong anymore you be just an attention seeker to them,1
you will not understand the pain unless you have felt it,1
everyone act like they care but they do not,1
that unexplainable feel of be alone and feel like i do not belong,1
this be what be happen,1
maybe everyone be lifes would be better if i just disappear,1
suicidal thoughts everyday,1
it be true that people only care if you be pretty or die,1
